# Grave Out - Unity Game (Preview Build)

**Description**

This is a preview build of Grave Out, a work-in-progress Unity game. It utilizes Steamworks for features like online lobbies, but error handling for offline scenarios is not implemented yet. As it's still under development, expect to encounter bugs and incomplete features.

This build creates player settings in your Windows registry ("Windows Prefs") and stores test save data in AppData/Roaming/.grave.
The save functionality is currently for development purposes only and may not work reliably.
